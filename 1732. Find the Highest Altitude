There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

 

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
 

class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        for(int i = 1;i<gain.length;i++){
            gain[i] += gain[i-1];
        }
        int altitude = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<gain.length;i++){
            if(gain[i] > altitude) altitude = gain[i];
        }
        return altitude;
    }
}
