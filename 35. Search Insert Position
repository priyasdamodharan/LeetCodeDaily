35. Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
Example 5:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: 0
 


My solution: 

class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
   for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]==target) return i;  // this means the value is present and we will returen the index
            else if(nums[i]>target) return i;  // this mean the array value is more that target value and 
			//we havn'e found any match yet this mean the value is not present so we will put target 
			//value in the index of its just greater value that is present at index i
        }
        return nums.length;

    }
}
